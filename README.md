# can-i-kite
Small Python app that collects weather data and switches a light on/off if kite conditions are good. 

# Getting Started
This is a Python script for use on a Raspberry Pi(4). 

# Installing
You are free to use the API key in the code. Install the file on your Raspberry Pi. For the wiring schema it is best to look here:https://raspberrypihq.com/making-a-led-blink-using-the-raspberry-pi-and-python/

I've left the SSL part in so you will not run into SSL certificate errors if you change the source url of the API.
